*   Increased LPCLK_DRIFT_VALUE to 500ppm
third_party/cordio/ble-host/sources/hci/ambiq/cooper/hci_drv_cooper.h

*   Adjust the handle of all defined services in stack to avoid handle conflict for different GATT database group.
ambiq_ble/services/*.h
third_party/cordio/ble-profiles/sources/services/svc_*.h

*   Added check for signature writing result, and separated afterwards process for versions lower/higher than 1.14

devices/am_devices_cooper.h
third_party/cordio/ble-host/sources/hci/ambiq/cooper/hci_drv_cooper.c

*   Discard the HCI received packet with wrong type or memory allocation failure. Set the HCI RX state back to IDLE.
third_party/cordio/ble-host/sources/hci/ambiq/hci_tr.c

*   For version higher than 1.14, decreased CS assertion duration to 100us in am_devices_cooper_blocking_write since we have added more CS detections on cooper side
devices/am_devices_cooper.c

*   Create the script to generate the SBL OTA binary for Apollo4.
tools/apollo4_amota

*   Disable ENABLE_BLE_CTRL_TRACE by default to save code size.
third_party/cordio/ble-host/sources/hci/ambiq/cooper/hci_dbg_trc.h

*   Same or lower version of Cooper firmware update will be done only through writing fw update signature through HCI even if the rollback is enabled
devices/am_devices_cooper.c

*   Rename the funtion-scope variable sbl_status in am_devices_cooper_reset_with_sbl_check() to avoid same name with the file-scope variable
devices/am_devices_cooper.c

*   Used macro for a few NVDS values so that they can be overridded easily for different boards.
devices/am_devices_cooper.h

*   Get rid of 500us delay in isr for generating 32M clock to Cooper with a 100-200us longer from 500us to 700us for 32M clock stablized with required accuracy. Cooper won't start any RF activity sooner than about 1.2ms after asserting clock request pin, so we're sure and safe that 32MHz clock can meet PPM requirement 1.2ms after clock request assertion
mcu/apollo4b/hal/mcu/am_hal_mcuctrl.c
mcu/apollo4b/hal/mcu/am_hal_mcuctrl.h

*   Changed NVDS_PARAMETER_WAKEUP_TIME to NVDS_PARAMETER_EXT_WAKEUP_TIME, and increased EXT_WAKEUP_TIME_VALUE and OSC_WAKEUP_TIME_VALUE to 1000us to give more margin
devices/am_devices_cooper.h
